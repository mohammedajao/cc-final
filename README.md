The following project fetches the top Spotify song from Spotify's public Top 50 playlist and visualizes its preview song.

A bearer token for the API call can be generated from:
https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist/?playlist_id=37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF&market=&fields=&additional_types=

This token may need to be regenerated if the current one is expired. You need a developer account to do so.
